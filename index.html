   <strong>Hello World! this is my first webpage</strong>
     <p> <strong>HTML and CSS</strong> <p>are two languages that work together to create everything that you see when you look at something on the internet.</p>
      <p>HTML is the raw data that a webpage is built out of. All the text, links, cards, lists, and buttons are created in HTML.</p>
      <p>CSS is what adds style to those plain elements. HTML puts information on a webpage, and CSS positions that information,</p>
        gives it color,
        changes the font, and makes it look great!</p>
      <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) defines the structure and content of webpages. We use HTML elements to create all of the paragraphs,</p><p> headings, lists, images, and links that make up a typical webpage. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em><strong>NOTE I COPIED THIS TEXT THEY ARE ORIGINALLY MINE</strong></em>
        </li>

       like a shopping list of items that can be bought in any order, then you can use an unordered list.
      Unordered lists are created using the (ul)> element, and each item within the list is created using the list item element (li)>.
      Each list item in an unordered list begins with a bullet point:
